                            <p>I have taken to drawing since a young age but have always struggled with being content at the results of my work. It has been a major obstacle to the development of my skills and thus I do still have much to learn, but I have greatly improved in recent years as I have began to accept my strengths and weaknesses, which has allowed me to make big leaps. While most of my early years have centered around drawing on paper with pencils, several years ago I made the switch to digital art and have since then mostly focused on a combination of sketches, drawing and paintings with much experimentation in style and composition.</p>

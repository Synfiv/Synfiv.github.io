                    <p>Hi, I am hobbyist 2D and 3D digital artist who has in the past drawn mostly for fun but am now looking to turn drawing and working with models and animations into a bigger focus of my life. If my work catches your interest I am happy to accept commissions so long as I have the capacity available.</p>
                    <p>Should you wish to get in contact with me for questions or commissions, you may do so at the social media links below, or via my E-mail address: synfiv@gmail.com</p>

                    <h3>2D Art</h3>
                    <p>Most of my past experience in terms of drawing was mostly with sketching, in particular of Synths and robotic characters. In general the majority of my work has been on character subjects as-well as a few object oriented pieces, and I find it enjoyable to make broad landscapes and vistas despite being somewhat amateurish with them so far. Despite the majority of my work being furry in nature, I will happily accept most other types of requests too, as-well as any furry species or setting within reason. Portraits or landscapes are both welcome.</p>
                    <h3>3D Art</h3>
                    <p>As something I have had a few more years of experience with, I was an aspiring animator working mainly with 3DS Max, initially mostly on first-person weapon animations for Source games. I have since branched out to other engines too and made the switch to working with Blender instead, and more recently I've taken up 3D modelling as-well and am currently trying to learn how to model properly.</p>
